üöÄ Blazing-Fast Inventory Management API
Welcome to a production-ready, high-performance REST API for inventory management, built with Spring Boot and supercharged with Redis for lightning-fast data retrieval.

This project is designed to handle high-concurrency environments with grace, ensuring data integrity and providing a seamless developer experience through comprehensive API documentation. It's more than just a CRUD application; it's a blueprint for building scalable and resilient microservices.

‚ú® Key Features
High-Speed Caching: Integrated with Redis (@Cacheable, @CachePut, @CacheEvict) to dramatically reduce database load and deliver sub-millisecond response times for frequent read operations.

Concurrency-Safe Operations: Implements Optimistic Locking (@Version) and automatic Retry Mechanisms (@Retryable) to handle race conditions and prevent data corruption during simultaneous stock updates.

Robust Error Handling: A centralized, global exception handler with custom exceptions (ProductNotFoundException, InsufficientStockException) provides clear, meaningful, and consistent error responses.

Interactive API Documentation: Pre-configured Swagger UI allows for easy exploration, testing, and understanding of all available endpoints right from your browser.

Clean & Scalable Architecture: Follows industry best practices with a clear separation of concerns (Controller, Service, Repository layers) and uses the Data Transfer Object (DTO) pattern to decouple the API from the database model.

Full CRUD Functionality: Comprehensive endpoints for creating, reading, updating, and deleting products, including paginated results for fetching all products.

Advanced Stock Management: Specialized endpoints to safely increase or decrease stock levels, crucial for e-commerce or warehouse systems.
